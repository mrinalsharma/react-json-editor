JSON Editor is a web-based tool to view, edit, format, and validate JSON. It has various modes such as a tree editor, a code editor, and a plain text editor.

Details of the editor could be found in https://github.com/json-editor/json-editor

I could not find the React implementation wrapper so tried to create one.

ScriptCache code is inspired from https://www.newline.co/fullstack-react/articles/Declaratively_loading_JS_libraries/.
